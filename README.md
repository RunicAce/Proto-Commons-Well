# Proto-Commons-Well

**A prototype for a public-domain Commons Well for speculative ideas**  

---

## Overview

The Proto-Commons-Well is a repository for **the Wells of Inspiration concept**, a system designed to capture and preserve human speculation in a public, durable, and accessible form.  

It is intended to:

- Provide a persistent home for ideas that might otherwise be lost.  
- Separate **ideation** from **implementation**, allowing contributors to share ideas without executing them.  
- Encourage free, creative thinking across all domains: science, technology, education, governance, arts, and more.  
- Offer a model for a dual-well system:  
  - **Commons Well**: fully anonymized, public domain, no attribution required  
  - **Attributed Well**: optional credit, suitable for commercial or institutional use

> *Not everyone wants to be a hero, but everyone can support heroes by leaving ideas in a place where they can flourish.*

- Contributors may remain anonymous.  
- Ideas are persistent and free for anyone to explore.  
- Implementation is separate from ideation — the repository exists purely to preserve and inspire.
